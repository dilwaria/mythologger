		<p>There are so many cultures in this world and each culture has its own Mythology. 
		The stories of these Mythologies has become popular as the inspiration of Fictional Contents as well as for the Bed Time Stories. Little do we know that these stories hold a huge significance in our day to day lives too.
		</p>
		<p>
		The matter here is, we need to understand these stories to retrieve its lost meaning.
		The presentation of these stories and the in depth understanding of it will help us to find the essence of these Mythologies. Once we are aware of that essence, we will know how to implement that in our life. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Our motto is the very same. It is to bring out the crux of these stories and to introduce its use in our real lives. We are here working hard to make the current generation benefit from what our ancestors have left for us.
